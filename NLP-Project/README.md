<b>This folder contains example code that can be used in various NLP projects.<b>
For example:
<ul>
<li><i><a href="https://github.com/drray30/MachineLearning/blob/master/NLP-Project/gettopicandsentiment.py"> "Example Script to run topic modeling and sentiment analysis on a sample review" </a> </i>. In this script, we can use the function to call topic modeling and sentiment analysis on a sample review text entered by the user. It assumes that pretrained models for the tfidf vector, topic modeling nmf model as well as tokenizer model are all stored and passed as arguments to the function written in this script. Obviously, this script cannot be run by itself without those pretrained models. Users will need to manipulate it according to their needs for it to work with their dataset and models. They can use the topicmodeling.py script to generate and store the pretrained models to be used with this script.</li><br>
<li><i><a href="https://github.com/drray30/MachineLearning/blob/master/NLP-Project/topicmodeling.py"> "Code for training and using NMF for topic modeling" </a> </i>. This script code can be adapted and used for pre-processing, training as well as topic modeling using NMF models. Once stored, the models trained in this script such as TFIDF, Vectorizer as well as NMF can be used by the gettopicandsentiment.py script.</li><br>
