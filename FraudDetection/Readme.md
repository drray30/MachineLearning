# FraudDetection<br><br>

This repository will contain a collection of python scripts/notebooks to demonstrate
the use of Machine Learning as well as Deep Learning techniques on common business challenge of Fraud Detection.
I will continue to add scripts to the folder to demonstrate how to handle the challenge of unbalanced datasets,
that is very common in Fraud Detection.
